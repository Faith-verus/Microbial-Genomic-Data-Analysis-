This tutorial will teach you how to code a GUI interactive image of 6MFZ protein of Bacillus Subtilis strain R31 using genome sequence obtain from NCBI database and a PDB file from protein Data Bank database. This project is for the beginner programmer. 6MFZ is a nonribosomal peptide synthase - a big enzyme that produces bio active compounds that are used to treat cancer. Note: code for this project is saved as "file.txt" in this repository.
